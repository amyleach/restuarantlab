    <p>We are Anthony, Fretz, Jamie, and Noah. We are chefs and food people. We started Top Round because we wanted a place to get good, wholesome food, fast. Growing up in cities like St. Louis and Buffalo, we remember old school roast beef sandwiches with cheesy sauce. They tasted great, and they were never made from mystery cheese. Here at Top Round, what you are eating is real food, made with the best cheese around. Each Top Round has a real kitchen. We prepare meats and veggies, cut french fries, and make cheeses in that very kitchen.</p>
